## 📆 Week-by-Week Breakdown

### 🧭 Weeks 1–2: Ramp \+ Integrate

**Goal:** Immerse in the product, systems, and voice; align with Tiffany; and support content execution from day one

**Strategic \+ Operational Alignment**

- Review, validate, and iterate 60-day plan with Tiffany
- Walk-through existing content infrastructure (calendar, briefs, docs, tools) to understand how to best plug in
- Define target cadence and ownership expectations across blog, case studies, SEO, email, and social
- Clarify what “quality” means for Mintlify’s content—by audience, channel, and format

**Customer \+ Internal Context**

- Begin customer immersion: find paths to better understand user behavior, language, and use cases—via live calls, feedback loops, and convos with users (both customers and non-customers)
- Schedule internal 1:1s across product, sales, eng, support, and design to understand what content they rely on, what gaps they see, and what’s coming up

**Content Execution**

- Support content production immediately as needed (e.g. blogs, social, email copy)
- Audit SEO structure, content gaps, keyword priorities, and opportunities to build or improve
- Assess email content across touchpoints (onboarding, support, feature drops)—with a focus on tone, clarity, and opportunities to surprise or delight
- Identify any case studies or customer features needed this quarter and begin coordinating interviews early

### 🔁 Weeks 3–4: Take Ownership \+ Build Momentum

**Goal:** Fully own core content channels and start leveling up both volume and ROI

**Execution \+ Production**

- Run weekly execution across blog, social, SEO content, and email in line with established volume goals
- Own SEO content planning: prioritize keywords, draft content, and track search performance
- Draft and publish high-quality pieces that map directly to business goals and user needs
- Develop light production systems (as needed) to streamline work—e.g. idea bank, SEO brief template, or checklist for product storytelling

**Cross-Functional Partnerships**

- Continue collaborating with stakeholders to surface new story opportunities (especially from product, support, and sales)
- Refine content formats and workflows based on what’s working—and what’s slowing us down

### 🚀 Weeks 5–8: Scale Output \+ Set Up for Long-Term Wins

**Goal:** Maintain content cadence while testing higher-leverage bets and system improvements

**Execution at Scale**

- Continue content production and distribution across all owned channels, maintaining quality and velocity
- Track SEO performance and adjust strategy based on results.
- Share draft insights with Tiffany on what’s working and where we can push further—across formats, tone, or themes

**Early Experiments \+ Iterations**

- Propose one or two small experiments to improve reach or resonance (e.g. interactive product embeds in blogs and case studies)
- Begin collecting inputs for a lightweight content retro at the end of 60 days to inform roadmap planning

## 💬 Initial Insights \+ Ideas

These early insights are based on initial product research and a conversation with a software engineer in Mintlify’s target audience. They’re directional, not exhaustive, and would be pressure-tested further after onboarding.

### 👇 Key Insights

- **Developers want to _play_, not be pitched.** Tools like Mintlify should feel like a playground from the first interaction. Remove all friction between discovery and the aha moments. 
- **Everyone hates writing docs—but teams live and die by them.** Senior engineers are often the best at it, but they’re too busy. Juniors need it the most, but struggle to create it. A tool that reduces the need for manual doc-writing—and surfaces changes automatically—can be a game-changer.
- **Docs are a high-leverage path for reducing meetings.** If Mintlify can promise to shave even four hours off an engineer or PM's weekly meetings they'll pay attention.

### 💡 Early Content Ideas

These are early-stage concepts I'd explore more deeply in Weeks 3–8:

- **Interactive Case Studies \+ Blogs**

  Embed live product previews (e.g. playgrounds, AI demos) inside content to make reading feel like using the product.
- **Hack-to-Case Study Flywheel**

  Host lightweight virtual hackathons offering special weekend access. Let users build with Mintlify and turn standout projects into authentic case studies or short videos.
- **Community Template Expansion**

  Expand the template hub à la Notion. Encourage user-generated templates and highlight them with blog features, videos, or social takeovers.
- **Short-Form Video Distribution**

  Test vertical video on LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, and even TikTok. Potential formats:
  - “Day in the Life” with Mintlify’s team (esp. engineers \+ PMs)
  - Micro-case studies or blog teases
  - Educational clips from existing posts
  - Repurposed product updates in a narrative tone
- **Micro-Creator Activation**

  Partner with respected technical voices—big and small. Even a single tweet from someone with \< 1K followers can drive powerful word-of-mouth. Feature them in smart ways and give them a reason to share.

## 👋 Closing Note

This plan reflects how I think, not just what I’d do. I see content as a lever for product-led growth, credibility, and community—and Mintlify is uniquely positioned to scale all three.

I’m here to learn fast, ship quickly, and extend product impact through content—while acting as a humble thought partner across the org. I’m excited about the opportunity to help tell Mintlify’s story in a way that builds trust and drives discovery.
